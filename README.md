#Offical Debian repository for stable SuicSoft software
To add to your Debian/Ubuntu installation , run : ```echo "deb http://suicsoft.com debian-stable/" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list``` and then run ```sudo apt-get update```. You can now install SuicSoft software using ```apt-get``` with ```sudo apt-get install <selected software>```. The reason for this repository is because ```apt-get``` gives an error if the path is ```http://suicsoft.com/Little-PDF-Merge/repo debian``` so we created this repository which you can install all your SuicSoft software from one repository and without the repo being in a folder (to avoid the ```apt-get`` problem)
